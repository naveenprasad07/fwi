# ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction App

## ðŸŒ² Overview

This project is a web-based application that predicts the **Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI)** â€” a key metric used to assess the likelihood and intensity of forest fires â€” based on environmental and weather-related data.

Built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **Scikit-Learn**, this app helps visualize fire danger levels for proactive risk management.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Predicts FWI using a trained **Ridge Regression** model  
- âœ… User-friendly form input for weather parameters  
- âœ… Scales input data using a **Standard Scaler**  
- âœ… Displays fire risk level based on FWI prediction  
- âœ… Clean web interface using HTML/CSS

## ðŸ§  What is FWI?

The **Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI)** is a numerical rating of fire intensity based on weather conditions like:

- Temperature
- Relative Humidity (RH)
- Wind Speed
- Rainfall
- Fuel Moisture Codes (FFMC, DMC, DC)
- Derived Indices (ISI, BUI)

### ðŸ”¢ FWI Danger Levels

| FWI Value Range | Fire Danger Level | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0 â€“ 5           | Low               | Fires unlikely or easily controlled |
| 5 â€“ 12          | Moderate          | Fires may start and spread slowly |
| 12 â€“ 21         | High              | Fires likely to start and spread |
| 21 â€“ 30         | Very High         | Fires start easily and spread fast |
| 30+             | Extreme           | Explosive fire behavior, hard to control |
